# Knowledge Summary - Cursor Auto-Accept Script

## What It Does
Auto-clicks Accept/Run/Apply/Resume buttons in Cursor and Windsurf IDEs. Tracks files, analyzes conversation diffs, and calculates ROI from complete AI workflow. Now with accurate file detection, separated button analytics, connection failure support, and multi-IDE compatibility.

## Key Features
- Smart button detection and clicking (including Resume Conversation and Connection Failure buttons)
- **Multi-IDE support** with automatic detection for Cursor and Windsurf
- **Universal file detection** from conversation context (any file type)
- **Separated button type analytics** with color coding
- **Connection failure support** for Resume/Try again buttons during network issues
- **Build system** for creating minified versions
- Diff block detection and conversation analysis
- ROI calculation from user prompt â†’ cursor completion
- Data persists in localStorage
- Control panel with Main/Analytics/ROI tabs

## Recent Fixes
- **Fixed file detection**: Now uses conversation-based approach, finds latest diff blocks by message index
- **Fixed NaN issues**: Safe number validation prevents NaN in analytics
- **Separated button analytics**: Accept (green), Run (orange), Resume (blue), Apply (purple)
- **Enhanced debug logging**: enableDebug()/disableDebug() with detailed file extraction logs
- Fixed TrustedHTML errors (no innerHTML)
- Fixed minimize button CSS
- Fixed duplicate log prevention
- Added validateData() and toggleDebug() functions
- Enhanced clearStorage() to reset everything

## Console Commands
```javascript
// Core automation
startAccept()           // Start automation
stopAccept()            // Stop automation  

// Data management
validateData()          // Check data integrity
clearStorage()          // Reset all data
calibrateWorkflow(30)   // Set manual workflow time in seconds

// Debug controls
enableDebug()           // Enable detailed file extraction logging
disableDebug()          // Disable debug logging
toggleDebug()           // Toggle debug mode

// Conversation analysis
findDiffs()             // Find all diff blocks
getContext()            // Get conversation overview
logActivity()           // Log recent activity
recentDiffs(maxAge)     // Find recent diffs (ms)
```

## Architecture
- SimpleAutoAccept class with localStorage persistence
- DOM-only manipulation (no innerHTML for security)
- **Conversation-based file detection** from latest message bubbles
- **Universal file type support** via pattern matching
- Event delegation and error handling
- Real-time UI updates with deduplication
- Diff block analysis with file change tracking

## Troubleshooting
- **File names not showing**: Use enableDebug() to see detailed extraction logs
- **File detection**: Script now searches latest 5 messages in conversations div
- **NaN values**: Fixed with safe number validation 
- **Debug file extraction**: enableDebug() shows message indices, code blocks found, filename attempts
- TrustedHTML: Fixed, uses DOM creation only
- Wrong values: Use validateData() to check
- Minimize: CSS .aa-minimized class works
- Duplicates: Intelligent message deduplication
- Resume not working: Check enableResume config

## ROI System Fixed
âœ… **Complete Workflow Measurement Implemented**:
1. Manual workflow: User prompt â†’ Watch generation â†’ Find button â†’ Click â†’ Context switch (~30s)
2. Automated workflow: User prompt â†’ Script auto-clicks instantly while user codes (~0.1s)
3. Real time savings: ~29.9s per AI interaction (99.7% efficiency)
4. Calibration: `calibrateWorkflow(seconds)` adjusts timing to user's actual experience

**New Commands**:
- `calibrateWorkflow(30)` - Set manual workflow time
- Shows realistic productivity gains in UI

## Resume Conversation Feature
âœ… **Auto-Resume Implemented**:
- Detects "Resume Conversation" links when hitting 25 tool call limit
- Auto-clicks to continue long coding sessions
- Configurable via enableResume checkbox
- Integrated with existing analytics
- **Separate tracking** in blue color coding

## Diff Block Analysis 
âœ… **Conversation Tracking Implemented**:
- Detects file changes in conversation diff blocks
- Tracks +/- line changes and modification types
- Provides conversation context and activity analysis
- Real-time monitoring of development progress
- Integrates with file analytics system

## File Detection Enhanced
âœ… **Universal File Detection**:
- **Conversation-based approach**: Searches latest messages by data-message-index
- **Any file type**: Pattern matching for files with extensions (not just JS)
- **Fallback system**: Tries conversation method first, then button proximity
- **Debug logging**: Detailed logs show extraction process step-by-step
- **Latest content**: Always finds most recent diff blocks

## Button Type Analytics
âœ… **Separated Analytics**:
- **Accept/Accept All**: Green (#4CAF50) - Standard file acceptances
- **Run/Run Command**: Orange (#FF9800) - Command executions  
- **Resume Conversation**: Blue (#2196F3) - Session continuations
- **Connection Resume/Try Again**: Orange-Red (#FF5722) - Connection failure recovery
- **Apply/Execute**: Purple (#9C27B0) - Other actions
- Real-time counters in Analytics tab with ðŸŽ¯ Button Types section

## New Features
- **TrustedHTML**: Use js inject way as they are in electron app. don't use raw tags, use js
- **File detection**: Use conversation approach not button proximity. search latest message by data-message-index in conversations div for diff blocks
- **NaN values**: Add safe number checks with isNaN fallback to 0 for all calculations
- **Separated button analytics**: Implement different button type tracking with color coding
- **Resume conversation auto-click**: Detect markdown links with data-link="command:composer.resumeCurrentChat"
- **Universal file detection**: Script supports universal file detection for any file type not just js files
- **Conversation-based file detection**: More reliable than button proximity method
- **Debug logging**: Essential for troubleshooting file extraction issues
- **README**: Completely rewritten with all new features and comprehensive documentation

## Renamed Class
- **SimpleAutoAccept**: Renamed to **autoAcceptAndAnalytics** throughout codebase

## Connection Failure Button Support
âœ… **Auto-Click Connection Recovery**:
- Detects connection failure dropdowns with "connection failed", "check your internet", or "vpn" text
- Auto-clicks "Resume" and "Try again" buttons in `.bg-dropdown-background` containers
- Separate configuration options: `enableConnectionResume` and `enableTryAgain`
- Orange-red color coding (#FF5722) for connection failure analytics
- Enhanced time savings: 4s for Resume, 3s for Try again (accounts for frustration time)
- Seamless integration with existing button detection and analytics systems

connection failure buttons added for slow/no internet scenarios, auto-clicks Resume/Try again in dropdowns, separate analytics tracking with orange-red color

## Multi-IDE Support
âœ… **Automatic IDE Detection**:
- Detects Cursor vs Windsurf automatically using DOM elements and class patterns
- IDE-specific button selectors: Cursor uses `.anysphere-*`, Windsurf uses `.bg-ide-button-background`
- Adaptive detection with fallback to global button search
- Shows detected IDE in startup message and logs
- Same functionality across both IDEs with appropriate selectors

## Build System
âœ… **Professional Minification with Terser**:
- `build.js` script uses Terser for safe JavaScript minification
- `cursor-auto-accept-simple.min.js` with 53%+ compression (133KB â†’ 62KB)
- Preserves all function names and global commands for debugging
- Syntax validation ensures minified code is error-free
- Automatic Terser installation if not available
- Run `npm run build` or `node build.js` to rebuild after changes

multi-IDE support added with automatic Cursor/Windsurf detection, professional Terser-based build system, adaptive selectors for each IDE

windsurf run command accept required pointerdown/up events; inject full pointer & mouse down/up before click

windsurf accept all file changes enhanced selectors for span elements with hover classes, reject button exclusion added
