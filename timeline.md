## [2024-12-28] Fixed Windsurf "Run Command" Accept Detection

### Changes Made:
- **Enhanced Click Simulation**: Added `pointerdown`, `mousedown`, `mouseup`, and `pointerup` dispatches inside `clickElement()` before/after the existing `click` event to fully emulate a human click sequence.
- **Compatibility Patch**: Ensures Windsurf's "Run command? → Accept" buttons (which rely on pointer events) are now recognised and triggered by the script.
- **Non-Breaking**: Original focus/keyboard fallback preserved; existing Cursor and Windsurf features remain untouched.

### Technical Implementation:
```javascript
// Inside clickElement()
const pointerDown = new PointerEvent('pointerdown', {/* coord data */});
const mouseDown   = new MouseEvent('mousedown', {/* coord data */});
// element.click(); // existing
const mouseUp     = new MouseEvent('mouseup', {/* coord data */});
const pointerUp   = new PointerEvent('pointerup', {/* coord data */});
```

### Reasoning:
- Windsurf's command confirmation UI attaches handlers to pointer down/up events, so the previous simple `click()` call was insufficient.
- Injecting the full pointer/mouse event lifecycle guarantees activation across all interactive elements without affecting previously functional features.

### Impact:
- **Run Command Automation Restored**: The script now reliably accepts terminal command suggestions in Windsurf.
- **Broader Robustness**: The enhanced event sequence improves compatibility with any future UI components that rely on pointer events.

## [2024-12-28] Enhanced Windsurf "Accept All" File Changes Detection

### Changes Made:
- **Enhanced Selectors**: Added more specific CSS selectors for Windsurf's file changes "Accept all" UI, including `span.hover:bg-ide-button-hover-background.cursor-pointer.select-none.rounded-sm.bg-ide-button-background`.
- **Improved Class Detection**: Extended `isWindsurfAcceptButton()` to recognize additional Windsurf-specific classes like `hover:bg-ide-button-hover-background`, `hover:text-ide-button-hover-color`, and `select-none`.
- **Reject Button Prevention**: Added explicit check to skip "Reject all" buttons to prevent accidental clicks.
- **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Added detailed logging when Windsurf buttons are found to help troubleshoot detection.

### Technical Implementation:
```javascript
// Enhanced selectors in findWindsurfButtons()
'span.hover\\:bg-ide-button-hover-background.cursor-pointer.select-none.rounded-sm.bg-ide-button-background',
'span[class*="hover:text-ide-button-hover-color"]',
'span[class*="hover:bg-ide-button-hover-background"]'

// Reject button exclusion in isWindsurfAcceptButton()
if (text.includes('reject')) return false;
```

### Reasoning:
- Windsurf's file changes UI uses `<span>` elements with specific hover and styling classes for "Accept all" buttons.
- The previous selectors were too generic and missed the specific combination of classes used in the file changes toolbar.
- Excluding reject buttons prevents accidental rejection of file changes.

### Impact:
- **File Changes Automation**: Script now reliably detects and clicks "Accept all" in Windsurf's file changes UI.
- **Better Detection**: More robust pattern matching for various Windsurf UI components.
- **Safer Operation**: Explicit rejection of "Reject all" buttons prevents unwanted actions.
