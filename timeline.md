## [2024-12-27] Enhanced File Detection and Fixed Analytics Issues

### Changes Made:
- **Improved File Detection**: Completely rewrote `extractFileInfo()` to use conversation-based approach as requested
  - Now searches latest message bubbles in `div.conversations` by `data-message-index` 
  - Finds most recent diff blocks rather than relying on button proximity
  - Added pattern matching for any file extension (not hardcoded to JS files)
  - Added comprehensive debug logging with `enableDebug()` and `disableDebug()` commands
- **Fixed NaN Issues**: Enhanced number validation in analytics to prevent NaN values
  - Added safe fallbacks for `addedLines`, `deletedLines`, and `timeSaved` calculations
  - Fixed percentage calculations with proper zero-division checks
- **Separated Button Type Analytics**: Added distinct tracking for different button types
  - **Accept/Accept All**: Green color coding (#4CAF50)
  - **Run/Run Command**: Orange color coding (#FF9800) 
  - **Resume Conversation**: Blue color coding (#2196F3)
  - **Apply/Execute**: Purple color coding (#9C27B0)
  - Added `ðŸŽ¯ Button Types` section in Analytics tab
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Added extensive debug logging throughout file extraction process
  - `enableDebug()` - Enable detailed file extraction logging
  - `disableDebug()` - Disable debug logging
  - Debug logs show message indices, code blocks found, filename extraction attempts, status parsing
- **Better Resume Handling**: Improved Resume Conversation link detection and analytics integration

### Technical Implementation:
- **File Detection Logic**: 
  ```javascript
  // Find latest message bubbles sorted by data-message-index
  const messageBubbles = Array.from(conversationsDiv.querySelectorAll('[data-message-index]'))
      .sort((a, b) => parseInt(b.getAttribute('data-message-index')) - parseInt(a.getAttribute('data-message-index')));
  
  // Look for diff blocks in latest 5 messages
  const codeBlocks = bubble.querySelectorAll('.composer-code-block-container, .composer-tool-former-message, .composer-diff-block');
  ```
- **File Extension Pattern Matching**: Detects any filename with extension using regex patterns
- **Button Type Normalization**: Maps button text variations to consistent analytics categories
- **Safe Number Handling**: `isNaN()` checks with fallback to 0 for all numeric calculations

### UI/UX Improvements:
- Button type breakdown with color-coded counts in Analytics tab
- Enhanced click logging shows button type and time saved for all actions
- Debug mode provides step-by-step file extraction logging
- Resume Conversation actions clearly distinguished with ðŸ”„ icon

### Debugging Commands:
```javascript
enableDebug()   // Enable detailed file extraction logging  
disableDebug()  // Disable debug logging
findDiffs()     // Test diff block detection
getContext()    // Check conversation analysis
```

### Benefits:
- **Accurate File Detection**: Uses latest conversation content instead of button proximity
- **Universal File Support**: Works with any file type, not just JavaScript
- **Reliable Analytics**: No more NaN values in time/percentage calculations  
- **Detailed Insights**: Separate tracking for different automation types
- **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting file detection issues

### Reasoning:
- User reported file names not showing properly - fixed by using conversation-based detection
- NaN values were causing display issues - added comprehensive number validation
- Need separate analytics for different button types for better insights
- Debug logging essential for troubleshooting file detection in complex UI structures

## [2024-12-27] Added Diff Block Detection and Conversation Analysis

- **File Change Tracking**: Implemented extraction of filenames, change statistics (+/-N lines), and change types (addition/deletion/modification)
- **Conversation Context**: Added `getConversationContext()` method to provide overview of development activity including total messages, recent diffs, and files changed
- **Real-time Analysis**: Implemented `findRecentDiffBlocks()` with configurable time window (default 30 seconds)
- **Global Commands**: Added four new console commands for conversation analysis:
  - `findDiffs()` - Find all diff blocks in conversation
  - `getContext()` - Get conversation overview with file changes
  - `logActivity()` - Log detailed conversation activity
  - `recentDiffs(maxAge)` - Find recent diff blocks with optional time limit
- **File Information Extraction**: Enhanced file data extraction from code block headers and filename spans
- **Change Statistics**: Added parsing of +N/-N format for lines added/deleted tracking
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for all diff analysis operations with graceful fallbacks

### Technical Implementation:
- **Target Selectors**: `div.composer-diff-block`, `div.composer-code-block-container`, `div.composer-tool-former-message`
- **File Detection**: `.composer-code-block-filename span` for filename extraction
- **Change Indicators**: `.composer-code-block-status span[style*="color"]` for +/- statistics
- **Conversation Container**: `div.conversations` for overall context analysis
- **Message Counting**: `[data-message-index]` selectors for activity tracking

### Benefits:
- **Development Tracking**: Monitor progress and file changes in real-time
- **Impact Analysis**: Understand scope of modifications across conversation
- **Session Analytics**: Track development velocity and change patterns
- **Debug Support**: Identify recent changes for troubleshooting
